# automation-fdms
Test automation project for FDMS software

Project root contains sub-project automation-UI and potentially automation-backend in the near future

## automation-UI
UI automation is done using Python binding for selenium v3

### Execution Steps
1) Install python v3.6
2) Use virtual environment(optional) - this is the preferred way but not required
3) Clone the repo
4) Install dependencies and packages through "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5) Run the tests through the commandline - TBD

TBD - Plan is to move the setup to a docker image
